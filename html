        <div class = "talkbub">
        
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Welcome to Astronomy Assistance! Here we cover not only Astronomy basics,
but also include detailed reports for all your essay needs! I am RedStoneGeeko, I compile all the infomation to be easily read by people like you! I began in Khan Academy, where I found my intrest in coding and Astronomy, so I put them together and made this beautiful(Debatable) website to help you!</p>
            <p style = "text-indent: 40px;">Astronomy is a <em>very</em> interesting subject, so I am glad you came here to learn all the facinating facts about
our universe! </p>
        <p>This is the basics page, where all facts are simplified. For more in detialed pages, go to the header and click the button!</p>    
       
        </div>
              <div class = "talkbub">

                <p>
                    This projects has been a work in progress since march 2023. I found a insane amount of interest in astronomy a while ago, and I kept learning a whole bunch of facts. And I figured: If I love it, there is someone else who would really enjoy a website dedecated to astronomy facts.
                </p>  

              </div>
<div class="talkbub">
            Buttons to go to each subject are listed below.
            <br>
            <a href = "#stars" class = "zoom">Stars</a> <br>
            <a href = "#bigbangbasic" class = "zoom">Big Bang</a>
            
        </div>
       
        <h2 class = "subhead1" id = "stars">Star Basics</h2>
        <div class = "talkbub">I love stars, they have the abbility to add a <em>lop</em> of complexity to our universe, for example:
        <br>
        </div>
                  <p class = "talkbubhigh">
                        Creating high enough temperatures to allow for new and more complex elements to form.</li>
</p>
<p class = "talkbubhigh">Sending out the more complex elements using Supernovae, which can help make planets.(This includes Earth!)</p>
          
    
    
    
        
        <h2 class = "subhead2">Star Cycle</h2>
        
        <p class = "talkbub">Stars start as clouds of gas, whether left behind from the Big Bang(Talk about this later) or other stars going Supernova,
of Hydrogen and Helium, around 75% of all the matter in the <em>ENTIRE UNIVERSE</em> while Helium takes up an estimated 25%(Note that Oxygen itself makes up only 1%, which is still an unimaginable
 amout.) 
        </p>
        <p class = "talkbub">Then we get to the beautiful and most stable version of a star! Main Sequence. This is when it starts fusion, which fuses Hydrogen from its core into Helium. 
This stage lasts the longest, and it determines the brightness and color of a star.
        </p>
        <p class = "talkbub">Red Giants comes right after Main Sequence. Its running out of Hydrogen and starts to fuse Helium into heavier elements.
The core contracts and heats up, while the outer layers grow and cool down. The star becomes larger and redder, and that's why they're called "Red Giants"!
        </p>
        <p class = "talkbub">Supernova, I mentioned this before, This is when the pressure from the star can no longer win against gravity, so it collapses. For smaller stars it will leave behind a White Dwarf, which is hot and dense.
            For larger stars it can leave behind a Neutron star or a Black Hole.
        </p>


        <h2 class = "subhead1" id = "bigbangbasic">Big Bang</h2>
        <p class = "talkbub">Ahh, the Big Bang. One of the most commonly exepted orgin theories, if that wasn't for the James Webb Space Telescope(JWST).
                While the JWST didn't compleatly remove the plausability of the Big Bang, it has certianly raised questions among the Astronomy community. For example:
        </p>
        <p class = "talkbubhigh">How did some galaxies grow so big and mature so fast in the early universe?
            
        </p>
        <p class = "talkbub">As I find more questions I will add more.</p>
